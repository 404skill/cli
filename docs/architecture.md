# 404skill-cli Architecture

## Overview
The 404skill-cli is built using a component-based architecture with a focus on separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. The application uses the Bubble Tea framework for the TUI (Terminal User Interface) and implements several design patterns to ensure clean, modular code.

## Core Components

### 1. Model (`tui/types.go`)
- Defines the main application state and interfaces
- Implements the state machine for application flow
- Manages component composition and communication

### 2. Components
Each component is responsible for a specific part of the application:

#### LoginComponent (`tui/login.go`)
- Handles user authentication
- Manages login form state
- Communicates with the auth service

#### ProjectComponent (`tui/project.go`)
- Displays and manages the project list
- Handles project selection
- Manages project status tracking

#### LanguageComponent (`tui/language.go`)
- Manages language selection
- Handles project cloning
- Tracks cloning progress

### 3. File Management (`tui/file_manager.go`)
- Abstracts file system operations
- Provides platform-independent file explorer integration
- Handles directory management

### 4. Styling (`tui/styles.go`)
- Centralizes UI styling
- Defines color schemes and visual components
- Ensures consistent look and feel

## Design Patterns

### 1. Component Pattern
- Each component implements the `Component` interface
- Components are self-contained and manage their own state
- Components communicate through well-defined messages

### 2. Command Pattern
- Operations like `cloneProject` are encapsulated as commands
- Commands can be executed and undone
- Provides clear separation between UI and business logic

### 3. State Pattern
- Application state is managed through a state machine
- Each state has its own update and view logic
- States transition based on user actions and events

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Progress updates are handled through observers
- Components can subscribe to relevant events
- Decouples event sources from event handlers

### 5. Strategy Pattern
- File operations are abstracted through the `FileManager` interface
- Different implementations can be provided for different platforms
- Makes the code more testable and flexible

### 6. Factory Pattern
- Components are created through factory functions
- Ensures proper initialization of components
- Makes component creation more maintainable

## Coding Practices

### 1. Error Handling
- All errors are properly propagated and handled
- User-friendly error messages are displayed
- Error states are managed at the component level

### 2. State Management
- State is immutable and updated through messages
- State transitions are explicit and documented
- State changes trigger appropriate UI updates

### 3. UI/UX Guidelines
- Consistent styling across components
- Clear feedback for user actions
- Progress indicators for long-running operations

### 4. Testing
- Components are designed to be testable
- Dependencies are injected through interfaces
- State changes can be verified through messages

### 5. Documentation
- Each component is documented with its purpose and responsibilities
- Public interfaces are documented with examples
- Complex logic is explained with comments

## Best Practices

### 1. Component Design
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use interfaces for component communication
- Implement proper error handling and state management

### 2. Code Organization
- Group related functionality in the same package
- Use clear and consistent naming conventions
- Keep files focused and manageable in size

### 3. Error Handling
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging purposes

### 4. State Management
- Keep state immutable
- Use messages for state transitions
- Document state changes and their effects

### 5. UI/UX
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Maintain consistent styling

## Future Improvements

### 1. Testing
- Add unit tests for components
- Implement integration tests
- Add UI testing capabilities

### 2. Error Handling
- Implement more detailed error types
- Add error recovery mechanisms
- Improve error reporting

### 3. Performance
- Optimize state updates
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Profile and optimize slow operations

### 4. Features
- Add more configuration options
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add more customization options

### 5. Documentation
- Add more examples
- Create user guides
- Document common use cases
